{xA slender {Ddrakyri {xstands here, emanating {Yp{yo{Yw{ye{Yr{x.
~
The brilliant silver eyes of the master Laerkai look deep into your
own, as if scouring your soul.  She is the leader of the Laerkai, the
elite protective force of the race, a rank which she has won through
centuries of power and loyalty.  Though each of the six Laerkai beneath
her represents a single house and excels in that house's specialty,
the master comes from a union between the Deriki and Myrxes houses.
Trained by both, she has become a lethal blend of sorcery and stealth.

The light seems to shift and change even as you look at it.  This is
the drakyri Mediator, a blend of the souls of those drakyri who devoted
their lives to the increase of wisdom and willingly gave their souls
in death to serve the council.  The Mediator resides over the council
when it is in session and resolves disputes.  Due to its ancient wisdom,
it passes the final judgment on all issues that affect the race as a whole.

blue marble fountain~
Blue marble, so dark as to appear black in patches where shadows have
fallen over the stone, has been sculpted into the form of a tall
sorceress, hands raised in the act of casting a spell.  Crystalline
water splashes from the sorceress' open palm, sparkling like colour
spray in the light.  The narrow face and chiseled cheekbones appear
elven, but twin wings rise from the shoulderblades, sculpted feathers
cascading over the sorceress' back like a cloak.

was just your imagination?  The water sparkles in the light.
