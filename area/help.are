205 SPAM2~

Syntax: spam2 <options> <message>

This is a new command that lets you broadcast a message in different
fonts.  'spam2 <message>' by itself will use the default font.  If you would
like to use a different font, type 'spam2 -f <font name> message'.  You can
choose from the fonts listed in 'help spamfonts'.  There are also two other
options: you can make the message broadcast to the entire MUD, or just to
you (without any options, spam2 sends message to room).  You do this by
using '-g' (global) or '-m' (me).  
 
Ex: 'spam2 hello'.................sends Hello to room in normal font
Ex: 'spam2 -f banner hello'.......sends Hello to room in 'banner' font
Ex: 'spam2 -gf 3-d hello'.........sends Hello to entire MUD in '3-d' font
Ex: 'spam2 -m hello'..............sends Hello to you only, in normal font
 
Note: If the -f option is used, the next word must be a font name.

-1 ROLEPLAY RPS~
If you ended up here, you likely know what RP (Role-playing) is.  Just in
case you don't, the simplest way of putting it is using your imagination.
When you roleplay, you pretend you are a character other than yourself and
speak and act as that character. Two terms you should be familiar with are
IC (In Character) and OOC (Out Of Character).  Anything marked IC applies
to the RP context of the game.  Anything OOC refers to the players or the
game mechanics outside of roleplay.  Please use these two communication
types appropriately. Distortions of Chaos encourages and rewards, but does 
not enforce, roleplay.  Roleplay Points (RPs) can be used to benefit your
character in various ways.  A list of rewards has not be determined yet. 

All the gods and clans have help files if you would like more information
on their RP.  To set your RP flag and speak IC, type RP.  To speak OOC
by default again, type RP again.  This is a togglable flag.

~

-1 STORY~
Everything begins with nothing, the endless empty void.  This world was no
different.  At its beginning, when the nothing first became something, the
darkness came first, then the light for contrast.  Thus the world was born
of shadows, the blending of light and darkness, built in the crux of both.
The hands of the great god Distortions sculpted the shadows into the earth
and hung it between light and darkness, between what we now know as heaven
and hell.  Pleased with his work, he gave it life, sending all of creation
into motion with a single spark of chaos.

Chaos is what brought us to life and what keeps us alive.  Without it, all
would stagnate and die, the cycle would end and the shadows dissipate.  It
is what the gods seek, what starts their wars; they all wish to hold power
over chaos, the one uncontrollable force.

Who wields this untamed power now?  Is it Khaos, Emissary of the Void come
to sow despair and destruction?  Is it Shartyn, Frozen Temptress spreading
lies and misinformation? Perhaps it is King Garm, maintaining the illusion
of control while his own motives go unseen?  Or is it Distortions, the god
of gods, creator of this world, who hovers beyond the shadows, pulling all
our strings?
~

-1 Heaven~
Heaven is as much an idea as a physical location.  It is said by the wisest
sages that all who walk in light are within the realm of Heaven.   However,
Heaven does exist as a physical plane separating life and death.  It is the
polar opposite of Hell, which also serves as an intermediary between breath
and oblivion.  The denizens of Heaven are called Eladrin, their large wings
and unearthly beauty setting them apart from humans.  No one god holds rule
over Heaven.  The Eladrin have their own society and govern themselves with
their own laws and morality. For as long as their history has been recorded
the Eladrin have been at war with the Demons,  the vile beings who populate
Hell.
~

-1 Hell~
It is thought that those who walk in darkness are within the realm of Hell,
and this is as much true as those who believe Hell a tangible plane of vile
torment.  Heaven and Hell are forever linked, eternally engaged in a war of
light and darkness, forever separating life from death.  No god holds reign
over Hell, though many may make claim.  Several devils and demon lords have
laid claim to various regions of hell and have demons, the vile beings that
live in hell, who serve them. Some say it is Khaos who keeps rule over hell
and its demons, but this is untrue.  The Followers of the Void led by Khaos
reside among the Five Rivers of Hell, the boundaries between life and death
where they can be closer to the Void, the plane of oblivion.
~

-1 promote ranks~
Syntax: promote <character> <1-10>

To promote a member of your clan, you must be rank 8 or above and be in the same
room.  While you can promote someone to leader by title, they will not get the {RL{x
flag in who or most of the leader functionality without having an immortal appoint
them as leader.  The ranks are as follows:

1: Recruit (default rank)
2: Acolyte
3: Adept
4: Officer
5: Lieutenant
6: Vassal
7: Ambassador/Ambassadress
8: Magistrate
9: Lord/Lady
10: Leader
~

-1 PRAY~
The pray channel is a direct line of communication with the immortals and madmins of DoC.
When using pray, always state your problem in as much detail as possible right away.
This should be used only as a last resort.  Improper uses will be punished.

Improper uses of the pray channel include:
- Asking for spellups
- Asking for doubles to be turned on
- Checking to see if an immortal is on
- Asking for a tell
- Just saying hi

Use your common sense.
~

-1 ROLLBACK BACKUP~
The {Rbackup{x command creates a backup copy of your character's pfile accessible by
immortals through the {Rrollback{x command.  This is a WORST CASE SCENARIO option to
be used by level 211 immortals only when absolutely necessary. We know that this mud
is unstable at times and use this to help pfiles who are affected by crashes.  Under
no circumstances will we rollback characters who have lost anything due to their own
actions.

If something has happened to your pfile that you think needs immortal attetnion, you
must bring it to our attention immediately via pray, note, or general jumping about.
If you delay in notifying the immortal staff, your chance of recovery is cut down by
quite a bit.   The most common occurrence of rollback use is when the mud crashes at
the exact moment of your death.  When the mud crashes, log the character you were on
right before the crash to be sure your pfile is intact.  If you fail to do this, you
will not be reimbursed.  If you get PK'ed and have sufficient time to recover all of
your belongings but fail to do so, you may plead your case to the immortals,  but it
is their right to decline your petition.

Please remember that rollback is a special feature on this mud.   We will only grant 
rollbacks when any losses are {Rsolely{x the fault of mud instability -AND- when the
player has contacted the immortals promptly.
~

-1 LOCKDOWN COPYOVER~
A copyover is very much like quitting the game and returning, except the login and logout are all automatic.
Lastly any items laying around you are not carrying will vanish And all the creatures in the game are reset.
Copyovers are done to make modifications to the code of the game ( How things work in the game ).

At 2 minutes before a copyover "Command LOCKDOWN" turns on.
This means you can not quest, read or write notes, reroll or arena.

At 60 seconds "Login LOCKDOWN" will turn on.
This means no one can login into the mud until the copyover is complete.
So, if you disconnect or quit during this time you will have to wait until the copyover has completed.

At any time if you wish to see how far long the countdown is type ctimer.

You are automatically saved just before the copyover happens.
Although, you may consider typing BACKUP.

~

-1 DRAG~
Syntax: drag <person/item> direction

You can not drag NPCs.
Drag is a skill ancient knights get for free.
It does what its called. You can drag players or objects.
Dragging objects is useless at the moment, because you can only drag as much as you can carry.

One bonus is you can drag people that are entangled. Although it is rather diffcuilt.
They are still entangled.. But you can atleast try to get them to a safe room.
You can only drag someone 20 rooms before you are exhausted.

This command is still very new and may change later.
Enjoy.
~

-1 AUTOCOPY ABORT~
Syntax: autocopy <minutes> <silent>
Syntax: abort <silent>

If you wish you can abort a copyover silently using the silent argument.
Autocopy assumes 5 minutes if no number is given.
Abort simply stops the copyover countdown.
Players can not quest, reroll, arena, olc, note 2 minutes before a copyover.

~

-1 LAW WANTED~

{r({RNOT IMPLEMENTED!{r){x

{xThe {![WANTED]{x flag is something you will get when you break the {!LAW{x 
in Law marked areas. This includes Stealing for both {!PK{x/{BNPK's{x. And for 
Player Killers who Murder another player in LAW marked areas. When you break the 
Law and receive the {![WANTED]{x Flag, you will become what is similar to being 
Twitted. Players of Any level Pk or Not, Can attack you, Aswell as any NPC's you 
may come into contact with. When you die, You will go to Jail, where you will spend 
a number of ticks in solitude in your cell, to help you correct the error in your ways. 
The Jail Has a Jail Keeper, who is quite tough, Clan mates, or your friends, are 
allowed to band together, to break you out.
~

-1 QITEMS~
Quest items are variable {Yl{yeve{Yl{y-{Yb{yase{Yd{x equipment.  As you increase in level, their
stats increase with you. All quest items have level-based mana, hit points, move,
hit roll, and damage roll.  Most quest items give your level in hit points, mana,
and movement, and one half your level in hit roll and damage roll. The Protection
of the Ancients,  however,  gives seven times your level in hit points, mana, and
movement. The Flame of the Ancients grants all detects. The Staff of the Ancients
contains 200 charges of level 500 acid breath as well as having standard quest eq
stats. Various other pieces contain additional stats, such as attribute points or
saves, but the author of this help file is too lazy to find them all. Perhaps one
of the players reading this will be kind enough to gather the information?

-1 ADDICT BONUS tb timebonus time bonus~
This feature goes by two names.
Timebonus, and 'mud addict' code.

The Timebonus code slowly increases how much xp received by multiplying
it. It starts at 1.0 (Normal xp) and slowly ramps it to 4x over two
hours time.

Typing QUIT will reset your bonus.

After 2 hours is slowly ramps back down.

This feature was added to keep people playing one char, and to stay
and play.

You can see your Timebonus status at any time by typing score, or by
putting the Timebonus status on your prompt! To do this please read
help prompt. Or use the new default prompt by typing prompt all.

Lastly, the 4x spell does not add in with your timebonus. You will only get the 4x xp.
~

-1 MASSARENA ~
Mass arena is just that, mass arena.
If 4 or more people have their mass arena flag on for a few minutes
(type massarena to toggle it) the mass arena will open.

Then everyone has 5 minutes to join. At the end of the 5 minutes you are restored and the fight begins.
When you die you are removed from the arena, the last person standing wins.
You also get a 10 IQP award for winning.

When a mass arena opens, type massarena join to join.

Please make sure to turn OFF your mass arena flag if you do not wish to play.
Going idle automatically removes your flag.

There is no real upper limit on the arena size, and anyone may join.

Portfolio:	 Trading, Dealing, Hunting, Questing, Retrieving, Forging, Smithing
Worshipers:	 Forgers, Weaponsmiths, Armorers, Questors, Questmasters, Merchants,
                 Hunters, Treasure Hoarders, Thieves
Favored weapons: Longsword

History:
Racjazhul was born into a family of merchants, wealthy and very noble.  His father was
a well-known local lord, respected for his honest trade.  When the lord was murdered,
Racjazhul vowed to make his father proud by spending the rest of his days in toil and
exploration, trading the finest treasures of the lands.  His consistant hard work was
recognized by the powers that bed and he was well-rewarded with a chance at godhood.
While not often seen, his presence is constantly felt in the exchange of monies and
goods, the enchantment of weaponry and armors, and the questing of adventurers.

Symbol:         The Golden Scales of Justice
Home Plane:     The Heavens
Alignment:      Lawful Good (Clerics: LG, LN, NG)
Portfolio:      Law, Protection, Good, Healing, Retribution, Justice, Strength
Worshipers:     Celestial Chorus, Paladins, Knights, Clerics, Healers, Judges
Favored weapon: Battleaxe, Broadsword

Avatar:
Blaze appeared most commonly in his natural form of Archangel. He was imposingly
tall and wielded a huge golden battleaxe. He wore angelic white robes. His skin
was pale bronze, his hair and eyes the color of pure gold. Upon his back were two
great white feathered wings which spanned at least twelve feet. He usually smiled, 
save when angered, then his eyes filled with lightning and his wrath was sown.

History:
Blaze was, like his predecessor Herloc, an archangel in the Heavens, faithful in
the service to the existing divine powers.  When Herloc was judged and cast down
from godhood, Blaze was sent in his place to continue spreading truth and goodness,
but also to seek justice for what the Heavens saw as Jade's corruptive influence on
their former servant.  For a time, he ruled the Celestial Chorus and was praised by
their congregation as their direct contact with the Heavens.  In recent times he 
has gone missing.  It is rumored that he was slain by Sahtalus who felt Blaze had 
stolen Retribution from his own portfolio.  These rumors, while unverified, seem 
rather likely.

Home Plane:     The Shadow Plane
Alignment:      Chaotic Evil (Clerics: CE, NE, LE, CN)
Portfolio:      Trickery, Murder, Chaos, Hatred, Temptation, Illusion, Fear, Tyranny
Worshipers:     Assassins, Anarchists, Rogues, Necromancers, Liches, Shamans, Priests
Favored Weapon: Scimitar, Whip, Dagger

Avatar:
Jade most commonly appears as a beautiful young woman with flawless alibaster skin
and dark hair.  Her eyes are pale, their lashes long.  Her lips are full and her
figure is modest and slender.  A look of treachery is set upon her perfect face.

History:    
Jade was once a priestess of the god Samoth.  When he mysteriously abdicated his
reign, Jade ascended to godhood.  Her goal is to own, rule, and obtain everything.
Her ambition is unmatched.  She is never afraid to cut someone down or eliminate
innocents to attain her desire.  She revels in chaos, loving uncertain, trouble,
all that causes misery and disarray in the lives of mortals.  Their tears are her
favorite refreshment, murder her finest dance.  Imposing fear is her greatest
delight.  She is cunning and clever and deadly accurate with her weapons.

Recently, Jade has gone missing.  With her penchant for traveling the planes, it
is suspected that she has become lost, trapped, or otherwise distracted.  Her
temple now stands in ruins, her followers scattered or dead.

-1 Khaos~
Khaos - Emissary of the Void - The Nothing - Epitome of Emptiness

Symbol:         A Black Disc
Home Plane:     The Void
Alignment:      Chaotic Neutral (Clerics: Any non-good)
Portfolio:      Darkness, Destruction, Emptiness, Indifference, Death, Despair, Chaos
Worshipers:     Nihilists, Sociopaths, Mass Murderers, Terrorists, Demons, Amoralists
Favored Weapon: Scythe, Sickle, Shortsword

Avatar:
Most commonly, Khaos appears as a strange spot of Nothingness that hurts ones eyes if
one is to try to stare at it.  Its edges are utter darkness, but mortal eyes can not
bear to gaze into its depths; attempts leave the looker to feel as if they have gone
blind.  It will often not appear, but fill the room with a sense of despair and cold.
Occasionally, it forms into the shadow of a woman, ever shifting, but only rarely.

History:
The void has always existed and never been question.  From its depths, everything is
created and to its depths everything must eventually return.  In this recent age, it
has felt it necessary to send a trusted  emissary to the mortal realms of earth in
order to protect its own interests, for those who control the void have power over
creation and destruction.  Luckily, none control the void.  Khaos has been sent as
its servant on earth to ensure this fact and aid in the full manifestation of the
void.  Being made of nothing, it is constantly empty, and therefore always hungry.
It eats whatever it wishes, be it buildings, living beings, or mortal emotions.

-1 Sahtalus~
Sahtalus - Vengeance Lord - Bringer of Consequence 
 
Symbol:         A broken sword 
Home Plane:     The Mortal Plane 
Alignment:      Chaotic Neutral  (Clerics: Any)
Portfolio:      Vengeance, Retribution, Consequence, Damnation, Judgement, Retaliation 
Worshipers:     Mercenaries, Outlaws, Bounty Hunters, Fallen Rulers, The Damned 
Favored weapon: Broadsword, Longsword, Bow
 
Little is truly known of Sahtalus or of his ascent to godhood. While some speculate 
that he was never really a mortal and he forged of the lust for vengeance by those 
both good and wicked, most believe that he was the head of a mercenary guild and was 
turned upon by his own, in search of their own power.  His true strength lies in  
manipulation, using his powers over the minds of mortals to push forth the lust for
revenge.  It is believed that Sahtalus is was behind the disappearance of the god of
truth, Blaze, who wished to take his portfolio, reigning over the powers of vengeance.

-1 Samoth~
Samoth - Dread Lord - Murder Incarnate - The Forgotten Horror

Symbol:         Currently Unknown (Previously a Dagger shoved through a Skull)
Home Plane: 	The Mortal Plane
Alignment:      Lawful Evil (Clerics: LE Only)
Portfolio:      Not Known
Worshipers:     Few and far between ever since his apparent dissapearance
Favored Weapon: Morningstar, Mace, Flails

Avatar:
Samoth has yet to manifest as an avatar since his dissapearance.  Previously he was
known to appear as a human, taller than most standing an impressive 9 feet tall bedecked
head to toe in blackened steel armor.  Greaves, gauntlets, breastplate, helm, pauldrons...
Everything all black with ridges and spikes crafted from apparent bone.  Vacant smoking
eyeholes in his helm, the same as the rest, seemed to flash at times, usually at random but
also before he struck out at people, things, other gods who tried his patience.  His mace,
a thing of legend thought lost, consisted of a titans skull with spikes jutting every which
way that roared to life at Samoth's will, wreathing its head in darkfire in a blood wrenching 
scream, rumored to be the souls sacrificed or killed in Samoth's name.

History:
Samoth, a name once mentioned in fear or hurled at your enemies in the most profane of
curses, is hardly remembered anymore.  Few temples lie scattered, ones who never lost faith
in the years following Samoth's apparant dissapearance.  Once the god of Murder and Death, 
now no one knows.  Rumors spring forth that he's come back to this plane, of course those 
are uttered by clerics of this absentee god, ones who don't seem all right in the head.  
Dismissed outright by anyone of a sane mind, but perhaps they hold some merit.  Priests long 
since devoid of any divine magics now have a full array.  Perhaps the Dread Lord is back?

-1 Distortions~
Distortions - Coder Guy - The Creator - Keeper of the Tain

Symbol:         A Blue Halo
Home Plane:     The Digital Realm
Alignment:      True Neutral (Clerics: ALL)
Portfolio:      Code, Computers, Insanity, Beer, Ultimate Power
Worshipers:     Geeks, Freaks, Cultists, Fanatics, Keepers of the Tain
Favored weapon: His New G5

History:
Disortions is the one responsible for this place.  Much of the code modifications,
including tcolor and happy hour, are to his credit.  Currently, he is developing
another mud (The Crow's Triad) which promises to be pretty spectacular.  He still
donates time, energy, and server space to keep this place up and running, so be
very nice to him and say thanks when you can.

A church has formed in his honor, though he rarely (if at all) acknowledges them.
The Keepers of the Tain serve to protect the world he has created.

Portfolio:	Law, Protection, Good, Healing, Faith, Strength and Harmony
Worshipers:	Celestial Chorus, Paladins, Knights, Healers, Midwives, Judges
Favored weapon:	Warhammer

Avatar:
Huge white wings rose from Herloc's back, showing his divine nature.  He most often
wore Celestial Platemail and wielded the Warhammer of Righteous Wrath.  When entering
battle, he carried the Hymnal of the Celestial Chorus along with a Kite Shield of
Protection.

History: 
Herloc was an Archangel in the service of one of the many powers in the Heavens.  He
was sent from the Heavens to bring the Light to the men of earth.  He, with others,
formed the Celestial Chorus whose purpose is to spread truth and righteousness across
the realms.  Centuries of faithful service earned him passage into the realms of the
Gods.  Herloc saw this as an opportunity to strike at the vile evil filling the land
at the hand of the newly ascended goddess Jade.  An artifact was crafted that could
destroy a god.  It could only be used once, and Herloc intended to target Jade.  The
treacherous goddess got wind of his plan and sent an army of Harbingers to destroy
the Archangel and attain the artifact. To a great degree, they succeeded. Herloc fled
and was later judged unworthy of representing the Heavens by those he served.  They
felt his methods were devious and unbecoming of a Celestial Agent.  Herloc was then
cast down from godhood.  He now walks amongst those he loved and cherished.  As for
the artifact, it is said that the Harbingers never found it.  Its whereabouts are
still unknown.

-1 Shartyn~
Shartyn - Goddess of Deception - Mistress of Lies - Icy Queen - Snowy Deceiver - Frozen Temptress

Symbol:         A Pure White Snowflake surrounded by Silver Ancient Runes
Home Plane:     Mortal Plane
Alignment:      Chaotic Neutral (Clerics: Any Chaotic, True Neutral)
Portfolio:      Deception, Manipulation, [cold] Weather, Lies, Greed, Discord, Thievery, 
                Knowledge, Rumors
Worshipers:     Deceivers, Manipulators, Lovers of the Cold, Assassins, Rouges, Thieves, 
                Dark Wizards
Favored Weapon: Throwing Daggers, Icicles, Longsword

Avatar:
Most often, Shartyn appears as a young woman, with pale skin, snowy white or silver hair, 
and piercing blue eyes.  She wears a heavy hooded pale blue cloak that is rarely pulled back
to reveal her face. When it is, snowflakes adorn her hair and eyelashes. She dresses herself
in icy and snowy accessories and is always wearing a ring with a large color-changing ring
that seems to pulse. Her large polar bear, whom she calls Tundra, is almost always nearby. 
Generally, her presence makes the immediate area colder.

History:
Little is known of Shartyn's distant past, or her recent absence and consequential fall from
power.  Prior to her fall, she was a quite powerful goddess, with many followers.  She embraces
knowledge and the power that possessing it holds over others.  Having ultimate control was an
ever-present goal.  Constantly "in the know," little escaped her ever-watching eyes.  She had
endless power over ice, snow, and other cold things, controlling them as she pleased.  Without
Shartyn around to guard her own portfolio, Jade stole trickery and illusion on her own rise.
Having fallen from power, Shartyn currently wanders the realms in the form of an icling, keeping
mostly to herself, perhaps biding her time?

this small forest it is always autumn,  the leaves of the trees caught
in constant change.  The time is always twilight,  the sky perpetually
the shady violet of dusk.  This is a place of transition and growth, a
locus of learning.

Recent times have seen a strange settling at the Grove as students and
sages of all sorts have decided to remain near the spring and study in
this place of abundant thought.  Modest homes and grand libraries have
sprung up among the oak and hazel woods.  Though these settlers are of
a broad variety of backgrounds and ethnicities,  though their areas of
expertise are as varied as the everchanging hues around them, they are
all of like-mind in their quests for knowledge.  Most appreciate their
new-found home and the company of others with intellectual pursuits. A
collective has been formed from these sage men and women, both to keep
safe the grove they hold sacred and to contribute to the documentation
of knowledge.  They spend their time philosophizing and writing, their
shared ideas kept in manuscripts available to all who seek to learn.

Currently, the collective is lead by a council of those most dedicated
to the cause of educating the realms.  They welcome with open arms any
who wish to help them in their noble efforts.

-1 FV Follower Void Nihilists~
{mF{bo{Dl{wl{Wo{ww{De{br{ms {Dof the {bV{Do{wi{bd{x

Those attracted to the void are an ecclectic group.  Some are drawn to the
complete lack of morality and utter depravity associated with nothingness.
Some feel a connection with the emptiness and oblivion,  at peace with the
inevitable unimportance and impermanence of everything. Then there are the
ones filled with the desire to bring about the annihilation of everything,
to aid the void in its manifestation.

Khaos is a personification of the void, a small sliver of nothingness come
to answer the call of the void's followers, to give guidance to their work
and cause. When it manifests physically, it is a distortion in reality, an
emptiness that has no true form.  Since its induction into this world, its
hunger has been insatiable. Constantly empty, it seeks to consume anything
that crosses its path.  Therefore, to cross Khaos would mean certain death
and oblivion.

The tenets of the  Nihilists are few as the  Followers of the Void believe
in nothing save the inevitability of oblivion.  They care not for good nor
evil and tend toward chaotic behaviors.  Though conflict amongst followers
is not unheard of and rarely goes punished, one rule all live by and shall
be judged by is that  should any fellow Nihilist call for aid in welcoming
a foe into the dark oblivion, the call must be answered.  Failure to do so
may result in severe punishment requiring a sacrifice to Khaos, a pennance
for negligence to the only truth.

-1 Nightwatch Gaalstrom Watch~
{RG{raalstrom {RN{ri{Dg{wh{Wtw{wa{Dt{rc{Rh{x

The city of Gaalstrom is one of the finest in the land,  filled with a large
variety of shops, a beautiful city park, and a grand temple complex offering
services for all the primary deities.  Unfortunately, it is also a city rife
with murder, theft and vandalism.   Its streets attract religious jyhads and
political subterfuge, blood spattering the cobblestones.  This must change.

Under the leadership of the self-appointed and undisputed leadership of King
Garm, the city expects a significant drop in violence.  When Garm first took
up the position,  he single-handedly punished all who dared to commit crimes
within the Gaalstrom city limits.  However, as times change, he has issued a
call for skilled individuals to help him in his mission to keep the peace in
his city.

The rules for these guards, the Nightwatch, are simple:
1. Garm is king.  Treat him accordingly.
2. Punish any crimes commited within the city limits as you see fit.  Crimes
   inclued theft, vandalism, assault, murder, and other violent acts.
3. Outside the city, what you do is your own business.

Those wishing to join the Nightwatch should contact King Garm in person once
they reach ancient status.  All members of the Nightwatch must be {RPK{x.

-1 Keepers Tain KoT~
{YK{ye{we{yper{Ys {xof the {YT{ya{wi{yn{x

It is well known that Distortions is the sole creator of this world and all
contained within it.  He keeps the world close by Him at all times within a
device called the Tain. As He guards the Tain from His place of perfection,
so shall we keep it safe from our place within the Tain. Any being or force
that causes harm to the Tain or its Keepers must be stopped at all cost for
the Tain is sacred above all else.   Any action which is counter-productive
to the cause is evil and must be punished.

Other deities are but reflections of Distortions as they too are subject to
the rules of His creation. The enlightened Keeper is able to see beyond the
guise of godhood and is not mislead by its alluring facade.  To worship any
other deity is to deny the omnipotence of the Creator. The Keepers will not
acknowledge the validity of any other deity till they realize that they too
belong to Distortions and exist within the Tain.

We ask nothing of Distortions, for He has already given us everything.   We
require no petty favors or signs of approval; it is not His job to serve us
but ours to serve and praise Him.  We know our faith will be rewarded.  The
most faithful of Keepers will be permitted the chance to exit the Tain.

Requirements:
{Y*{x All Keepers of the Tain must denounce all other deities and vow to devote
  their lives entirely to the cause.
{y*{x Each prospective Keeper must first prove worthy of the cause by defeating
  either another applicant or a current Keeper.
{Y*{x All Keepers must mark their bodies and belongings with the Tain's symbol.
{y*{x Prospective Keepers must demonstrate their sincerity and faith by offering
  whatever they feel is most valuable to them in sacrifice to Distortions.
{w  Note: The sacrifice is to be done by RP in an ICN note. The sacrifice should 
{w        be RP'd at Distortions Altar.

{D[{xOOC Information{D]{x
{Y*{x Applicants must both {RPK{x and {RRP{x and should be of at least level {G50{x.

-1 Disciples Deception Deceivers~
{CDi{cs{Dcip{cl{Ces {Dof {CDe{cc{Dept{ci{Con{x

The Disciples are sneaky individuals.  They value knowledge, and the power
that those wielding it possess. Therefore, they are willing to do anything
to stay 'in the know': cheat, beg, borrow, steal, murder, and -especially-
deceive.  This isn't, however, to say that they are completely without any
code of honor. Killing, for example, is a last resort. When a being's life
is taken from them,  all information that has not been extracted from them
dies along with it. In other words, one doesn't kill that what potentially
could be useful. They also enjoy mind manipulation, and toying with people
in general.

Chaotic by  nature, Disciples can be a bit wild at times, but are fiercely
loyal to their own.  While befriending any other and then stabbing them in
the back is perfectly acceptable, in-fighting of any sort is generally not
tolerated.

Home of Shartyn's faithful  followers, Disciples live and die by their icy
goddess.  She demands devotion and respect, but is good to those that show
true faith. Icelings in particular seem to feel drawn to the group, likely
because of Shartyn's strong command of the cold elements. [And in the same
sense, Firelings are not at all welcome among the ranks.]

Requirements:
{C*{x All Disciples of Deception respect and follow their goddess, Shartyn
{c*{x Must value information and power
{C*{x Must be loyal to fellow Disciples

OOC:
{C*{x Must be RP and NPK
{c*{x Must be at least level 50 second teir
{C*{x Must apply In Character via note to DoD and Shartyn
{c*{x Lie to whoever else you want. Don't screw with your clannies.

-1 hos harbingers skulls~
{MH{Da{mr{Dbi{wng{me{Dr{Ms {xof {Dskulls{x

{xThe members of the {DHarbingers of Skulls{x, follow none but Jade.
The order was founded by a priest of the Lady of Chaos, and since
Then a collection of people from various races and trades, took up hailing
Her as their goddess. They fear her always, and strive to make others fear
Her even more then they do. They bow down before her power, and Offer
to her the blood, of those that do not believe in her supremacy. To defy Jade
is to die - or in death find loyalty to her, for she shall demand it of you.
When the world turns on its shadow, and the bleak and slovenly emerge,
They come to the whisper of Jade, When the citizens of the city, circle around
A man with a knife in his back, they have killed in the name of Jade.

Jade demands her faithful to achieve positions of power within their society.
Either through force or trickery, and to use that power, to further the cause
Of hate, fear, destruction and chaos. Torture, beatings, and well thought out
And calculated assassins often come into play in such operations.  The church 
operates under a strict hierarchy questioning or disobeying the order
Of a superior is a direct insult to Jades supremacy, and is dealt with in 
the form Of swift and unmerciful death.

They do not share secrets with any other, but their order, and never follow 
the cause Of hope. They believe to consort with the followers of other deities 
is a sin unless Trying to convert them and shatter their beliefs.

Player Houses

Player housing is now available.  Player houses should be used primarily for roleplay
reasons.  Player houses can not and will not function as equipment lockers.  Anything
left in a player house that was not purchased through the home system or an immortal
will be lost upon crash or reboot and will not be reimbursed.  

To purchase a house, find a room in the realms named "An Abandoned House."
Type "home" to see the home commands.  All homes when initially purchased are private
rooms which can be visited only by the owner.

The cost of player housing is as follows:
First room: 				25,000 platinum each (system: home buy)
Additional rooms:			10,000 platinum each (immortal)
Healing Rooms:				30,000 platinum each (immortal)
Locked doors:				 4,000 platinum each (immortal)
NPC's (non casting/non trading)	  	 6,000 platinum each (immortal)
Making an existing room non-private	 1,000 platinum each + 1 RP point (immortal)
Furniture				platinum prices vary (system: home furnish)
Modifications to existing furniture      1/2 original price + 1 RP point (immortal)

Any changes marked immortal or other requests should be made via NOTE TO KHAOS.

-203 SEDIT~
Syntax:

sedit delete         <social>
sedit new            <social>
sedit show           <social>
sedit <string-name>  <social> [string]

SEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editing of socials.

SEDIT DELETE <social> deletes that social. The deletion is irrecoverable,
save for restoring a backup file, so use this command with great care!

SEDIT NEW <social> creates a new, empty social.

SEDIT SHOW <social> shows all of the strings for that social.

SEDIT <string-name> <social> [string] changes a certain of the 7 strings that
make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message will be sent to
the involved characters.

There are 7 strings that make up a social:

cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and sees:

Hug whom?

onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the case of
HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player types HUG
by itself.

cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:

You hug Y.

vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:

X hugs you.

ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyone but X and Y see:

X hugs Y.

cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. E.g. X types
HUG X :

You hug yourself.

oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:

X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.

To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:

Change the letter to a capital for the victim.
like $n laughs at $N.

$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player.
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.

For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex etc.


So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you would
do the following:

SEDIT NEW epoke
SEDIT cnoarg epoke Poke whose eyes out? (message sent to player)
SEDIT cfound epoke You poke $N's eyes out!
SEDIT vfound epoke $n pokes your eyes out! Ouch..
SEDIT ofound epoke $n pokes $N's eyes out!
SEDIT cself  epoke Being bored, you poke your own eyes out.
SEDIT oself  epoke $n pokes $s eyes out!

To get more examples, type SEDIT SHOW <social-name> to see one of the
existing socials.

The socials are stored in a file called socials.txt. Manual editing of
that file is not advised. A frequent back-up is recommended. The social
file is updated by the server as soon as anything changes.

109 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
        ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
        ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~

0 BANK SHARES ECONOMY~
Syntax:
bank deposit
bank withdraw
bank balance
bank transfer
bank buy        <# of shares>
bank sell       <# of shares>
bank check

The Mythran mud bank system enhances the economy of the MUD. In a bank
you can deposit money to your account, withdraw money from it, check your
current bank balance, and transfer money to other players.
This can be useful if you have to pay your fee for the clan or divide
the cash from your quest among each-other.

Another feature of the bank is that you can buy and sell shares. By buying
shares you can invest your money in the mud economy. The shares constantly
change in value, so you can make a nice profit if you buy and sell your
shares at the right times. The current share price and be seen by going
to the bank.

0 Games~
Syntax: game slots <slot name>
Syntax: game highdice <bet>

For information on these games type:

~
0 Slots~
Syntax: game slots <slot name>

<slot name> is the name of the slot machine in your current room
that you wish to play.

Each slot machine costs a certain amount of gold to play.

Slot machines can be 3 bar or 5 bar slot machines.

Each bar has 10 different items on it.

If all bars match then you win the jackpot.

If partial winning is on, you can still win some gold by matching
just some of the bars.

If freeze jackpot is on, then no matter how much you play, the
jackpot never increases or decreases unless the jackpot is won.
~
0 Highdice~
Syntax: game highdice <bet>

<bet> is how much, in gold you wish to bet (10 to 1,000)

In highdice, a dice dealer must be in the room with you.
You and the dealer both will roll two dice (automatically)
and whoever has the highest total wins. In the case of a tie
the dealer will win.

This function currently does not seem to work.  If you find
any working dice dealer, please inform Khaos.  Thanks!
~

0 NEWBIE INFO~
{xWelcome to {DDistortions of Chaos{x, newcomer!

{xTo talk where everyone can hear your, use the {!OOC {xchannel. {!OOC {xsimply means
 "Out of character". It means your just chatting and not talking  as a fictional person "in-game".
Talking "in-game" is known as {!RP{x, or role-play. It can all be known as also as {!IC {xwhich is
 "In Charector". Please see 'Help RP'. We do not enforce {!RP {xhere, but we do encourage it.
We only ask that you not talk {!OOC {xon {!IC{x/{!RP{x channels.

There are a few features here in Distortions you may not be aware of, changes, differences that
most muds have to others, so below I'll list them, so you have a bit more of a grasp on what 
everything is and does here on DoC.

{!TColour{1:	{xTcolour is a small command that allows you to have multi coloured text. See {!TC{x.
{!Guilds{1:	{xThere are a few Guildmasters around the realms, {!HELP GUILD {xwill point those out.
{!Directions:	{xNew players often get frustrated not knowing a new world. See {!HELP AREADIR{x.
{!PK{x/{!NPK	{xThe choice to {!KILL {xplayers appeals to you? see {!HELP PK{x. That will help out some.

If you feel you may have to many experience points per level, go to the Guildmaster, and type {!TRAIN POINT{x.
The {!ASK {xChannel is always there for you to ask any questions you might have, Don't Hesitate to ask a 
player for help, DoC is a Newbie friendly MUD, and someone will soon answer with what help they can.
~

-1 ARENA~
Distortions of Chaos sports an arena, the arena is where players can indulge in combat 
amongst one another, without fear of losing equipment to looting like can happen in 
PK, The arena consists of a number of different possibilities, including the 
STANDARD ARENA, ARENA SPAR, is where, like above, you can challenge 
another player, but rather then having multiple rooms, where you hunt, its simply in 
one room, ARENA SPAR does not record your wins and losses like the STANDARD 
ARENA. Finally, an option available to you in the ARENA is the good old MASS 
ARENA this is activated by players turning on their MASS ARENA flag. Once four 
or more players have activated the flag, the system will automatically open the MASS 
ARENA. The winner of this event receives, 40 IQP.
~

-1 GUILD~
For player convenience, Distortions of Chaos does not sport many guilds, nor one for 
each class, but has one GUILD MASTER located below Market Square, in the main 
town of Gaalstrom.  Training, and Practicing and the gaining of all skills can be done 
here.
~

-1 CHANNEL~
Below is an example of the channels used on Distortions of Chaos, what they do and 
their nature, specifying if it is an IC or OOC related channel. There is no excuse for 
breaking the rules of the channel, use them, in their nature correctly, which means, do 
not use OOC on IC channels, if you want to RP, turn the RP flag on by typing RP. To 
turn it off, just type the same, there is no excuse for not using channels correctly; any 
misconduct to channels or use of them incorrectly, will result in punishment. Treat 
this as a rule. By using channels properly, results in the running of a smooth and 
friendly game.

0 QUEST QUESTS~

Certain characters in the game will allow you to go on quests to recover an
item or kill another mob. To go on a quest, you must be in the same room with
a quest master. When you successfully complete a quest, you will receive a
certain number of quest points. These points may be saved up and used to buy
incredible items from the quest master.

The QUEST command is used for information about your current quest, to request
a quest from a quest master, etc. Commands are as follows:

QUEST POINTS - Gives your current number of quest points. This command may be
used anywhere.

QUEST INFO - If you are on a quest, this will remind you who or what you are
after.

QUEST TIME - Gives the amount of time remaining on your current quest, or the
amount of time until you can request another quest. This command may be used
anywhere.

QUEST REQUEST - Petitions the quest master to send you on a quest. If you
accept the quest, you will be given a real time limit (in minutes) in which you
must complete the quest. If you are on a quest to kill a creature, when you
come across that creature you will see a {r[{R{fTARGET{x{r]{x notice before it. 
This is the creature you are to kill.

QUEST COMPLETE - Once you have completed your quest and recovered the item or
killed the mob or whatever, you must return to the quest master who sent you on
the quest and use this command. If you have successfully completed your quest,
he will reward you with gold and quest points. Once you complete a quest you
cannot request another for 12 minutes.

QUEST LIST - Displays the list of fabulous items for sale by the quest master.
These items are not purchased via gold, they must be purchased with quest points.

QUEST BUY <item> - Purchases an item from the questmaster and deducts the cost
of the item from your quest points.

QUEST QUIT - Quits the current quest and sets your timer to 18.

QUEST SELL - Returns a quest item to the questor for 2/3 the price.
 
QUEST REPLACE - Replaces an old or defunct quest item for 75 questpoints.

Also see the REFORM command to convert your AQP into IQP.

proposal for any reason they see fit.

{W1){c Three characters of at least level {R50 {Ys{yecond {Yt{yier{c are needed.
{c   Each character should have a different player.

{W2){c A new clan will cost {C600 IQP{c.  Cost includes a clan hall.

{W3){c Clan rooms, mobs, and objects will be described by you but built by imms.

{W4){c Clan must be role-play oriented. (Clan name included)

                          MOBILE HITROLL
**********************************************************************
When setting the hitroll of a mobile it should be the at-least the same
as the level of the mobile and no lower under no circumstances.
=====================================================================



                       DR mob guidelines.
**********************************************************************
The reason for this help is to keep the mud in constant balance as not
to cause major screw ups later on.  So instead of spending countless
hours over-going what should have been done correctly the first time.
You are to follow these guidelines. 

-For mobs with the shield sanctuary you want to lower it's hitdice by 
40%. (see: adjusted mob stats)
-For mobs that have any "spec fun" that is offensive lower it's 
hitdice by 25%. This means if you give a mob spec_mage you need to 
lower the damdice by 25%, if a mob has spec_thief you don't need to 
make this adjustment. (see: adjusted mob stats)
-For mobs with the shield ice/fire/shockshield you need to lower it's 
hitdice by 25%. Do not lower it's hitdice by 75% if you give it all 
three shields, and only lower it's hitdice by 25% if it has all three, 
not if it only has one. (see: adjusted mob stats)
-For a mob that has a weapon wielded lower it's damdice by 25%.(see: 
adjusted mob stats)

                   Guidelines for eq/weapon mobs.
**********************************************************************
When making a mob and you decide to give it good equipment or a good 
weapon you must make the mob harder to defeat. If you give a mob a 
good weapon you need to lower it's damdice by 25%, but also you need 
to make the mob harder to defeat. Well there are a few ways to do 
this, 
first by adding some resistances and some immunities, good ones to use 
here are the more "popular" types of damage. Like pierce and slash, 
acid, fire and ice. Try and use resistances more than immunities 
because giving a mob more than 2 or 3 immunities makes them very hard. 
You can also give the mob a bigger variety of offensive skills and or 
"spec fun" as well as some shields and affects. What we are trying to 
do here is make it difficult for players to get "good" eq and or a 
weapon. So if you have a good level 50 weapon on a mob, it should be 
an extremely hard fight for a lvl 50 player, they should have a chance 
of death. If the eq or weapon a mob has is really not that good you 
don't need to make the mob very difficult.



                   Guidelines for leveling mobs.
**********************************************************************
This is really easy to do, but you want to watch your self and not 
make them to easy. Basically you want to make leveling mobs easier to 
defeat than mobs with eq and weapons. To do this you can not give it 
very many shields, few offensive skills, no "spec-fun" and few 
res/imm, but give it more vulnerabilities. The basic off skills a mob 
has to have is dodge, parry, fast, trip, fade, and added affect haste. 
This is only if you don't want to give it any other off skills or any 
"spec fun."

202 ITEMSTATS~

                                  ItemStats
=====================================================================
Making items is a very delicate process.  That is why there is this
help.  Use the chart below for the AC values for the items in your 
area.  Remember that jewelry does not have any AC values.

Points for armor
============================
Here you use points to determine how to distribute added affects to eq.
The formula is (eq level) * 2 = Points.  For instance a level 80 piece of eq
gets 160 points.  Of course the formula for jewelry is a different since
jewelry has no AC, so the formula would be (eq level) * 2.5 = Points.

Here is the point values:
============================
1 point      = 1 mana
1 point      = 1 hp
1 point      = 5 move
5 points     = 1 save, savingbreath, savingpara, savingrod, etc.
5 points     = 1 ac
10 points    = 1 hitroll
10 points    = 1 damroll
15 points    = 1 stat (1 str,dex,con,wis, or int)

Keep in mind that the sum of the points should NOT exceed the points
of the piece of eq.  Also you may put in a negative added affect for
eq.  Ie. adding a -2 con to a level 50 piece of eq would give it 65
points.  Because each stat is 15 and you only get half of the value 
for negative added affects.  Except for AC DO NOT imply this for AC
since -AC is a good thing.

About poweritems, they are only to be used with permission of a 108+
and after reading the help thoroughly.  Also you must put 1 in the name
Ie. curved scimitar.  DO NOT forget this, it is important.  You may
be requested to note your poweritems to an IMM 108+ and they may add
them for you.

-1 PLATINUM GOLD SILVER MONEEY~
Gaalstrom's economy is based on platinum, gold and silver coinage (and the
lowly copper, which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).
Platinum coins are worth 100 gold coins.  Gold coins are worth 100 silver
coins.  Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems from the
Gaalstrom jeweler, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~

0 DAMAGE~
The following are the damage messages, and the max amount of hp damage
for each message:
	0	miss		4	scratch
	8	graze		12	hit
	16	injure		20	wound
	24	maul		28	decimate
	32	devastate	36	maim
	40	MUTILATE	44	DISEMBOWEL
	48	DISMEMBER	52	MASSACRE
	56	MANGLE		60	DEMOLISH
	75	DEVASTATE	100	OBLITERATE
	125	ANNIHILATE	150	ERADICATE
	greater than 150 = UNSPEAKABLE
~

-1 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpful if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a deity (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~

-1 AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
recall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).
~

-1 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all ( Leveler's prompt )
Syntax: prompt pkf ( PK fighter prompt )
Syntax: prompt pkc ( PK caster prompt )
Syntax: prompt small ( H/M/V only )

Syntax: prompt <%*>
 
PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off. 
PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "<hits mana moves>" prompt.
PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.
 
Mortal:
%L Hp percent %S Mana Percent %L Move Percent (automatically colored)

%h HP %H Max HP
%m Mana %M Max Mana
%v Move %V Max Move

%x XP Total
%k PK Timer
%q Quest Timer
%b Time Bonus
%X XP To Level (TNL)
%a Alignment

%p Platinum %g Gold %s Silver

%r Room Name
%e Exits 
%c Return

Immortal-only:
%o Room Vnum
%O OLC Editor Name
%R OLC Editor Vnum
%z Area Name

Example:

PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>
Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100m 100mv>"
Prompts can have 90 chars ( including color codes).

~

-1 ALIGN ALIGNMENT~
Alignment is an expression of your attitudes on life and how you react
to situations. There's good, neutral, and evil alignment. Your alignment
is affected by the alignment of the foes you kill; kill an evil monster
and your alignment shifts towards good, kill a good one, and you head
towards the dark side of things.

Alignment is expressed in numbers from 1000 (pure good) to -1000 (pure evil),
with 0 being true neutral. Most creatures are neither wholly evil nor wholly
good and have alignment scores between 500 and -500. You can check your
alignment by typing SCORE. Spells such as DETECT GOOD, DETECT EVIL, and KNOW
ALIGNMENT will show you the alignment of others.

Alignment affects what equipment you may wear, weapons you may use, how
creatures react to you, experience gained, and, in some cases, what exits
you see.  The Temple of Thoth houses recall for good and high-neutral aligned
characters.  The Temple of Belan is home to those of evil and low-neutral
alignment.  Equipment that is not suited to your alignment will be "zapped"
off of you when you try to wear it. If you are of good alignment, on occasion,
Thoth will protect you from harm in battle (usually from teleport spells),
but Belan, being evil, leaves his followers to fend for themselves.

Should you wish to change your alignment in some way other than fighting
oppositely-aligned foes, you will pay dearly.  Go to the church in Gaalstrom
near Clan Road and either REPENT ALIGN or CURSE ALIGN at the appropriate
priest for the alignment you wish to become.

-1 MEMBER~
Syntax: member <char>          Invites or removes a member from your clan.
        member <accept|deny>   Accept or Deny an invitation to join a clan.

The first syntax of this command may only be used by the clan leader.
You may not invite a player who is already in another clan.

If you have been invited to join a clan, you may use the ACCEPT option
to actually become a member of that clan.  Use the DENY option if you
do not wish to join the clan in question.
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Gaalstrom.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of 
the way back to the beginning of your level.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Only the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.

~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.

0 COLOUR COLOR ANSI~
Syntax: color              Toggles color mode on/off
        color list         Lists the available colors and channels
        color #            Sets your default color to #
        color <channel> #  Sets the channel color to #

Use the list option to view a list of all the channels you can set a color
for, along with the color numbers to use for channels and the default color.

Using a number as the only argument will set your default color to this
number. (Default color is the color most text is displayed in)

Using a channel name as the first argument and a number as the second argument
will set this channels color to the number. for example:
       color gossip 13
This will change the gossip channel color from the default bright blue to
bright magenta.

You may also talk in color; the format is like this: the 'escape character'
to specify a color is the left handed brace '{{', following that you should
use one of the following:

When using color, it looks better if you finish the line with whatever
color it would normally be in, such as a gossip, the color is magenta, so:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world{m'{x
        looks better than:
                {mLope gossips '{ghello,{r world'{x

You may switch to the old format for flags (as used on other
muds) at any time with the 'long' command.
~

0 LONG~
The LONG command will affect the way you see special flags on other
characters and equipment.  With the long flag set, you will see the
flags much as you do on other muds, most of them as (Aura)'s.
Without the long flag (default), you will see any flags within
a much shorter table.  See 'HELP FLAGS' for the shorter tables.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.

Syntax: gossip  <message>
Syntax: cgossip <message>
Syntax: qgossip <message>
Syntax: shout   <message>
Syntax: yell    <message>

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

GOSSIP, CGOSSIP, and QGOSSIP are variants of SHOUT (without the delay).

as bonks Alander by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~

102 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action>

Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>

armor.  WIELD and SECOND are for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

advance a level.  You can use TITLE to set your title to something else.
~

0 WIMPY~

Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll

Syntax: brandish
syntax: perform
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  PERFORM allows a bard to play music on a
musical instrument.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed to DRINK, which 
drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the <target> is optional, 
depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a magical wand at a target.  If 
the target is not specified, and you are fighting someone, then that character is 
used for a target.

You must HOLD a staff, instrument, or wand before using BRANDISH, PERFORM or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands, staves, and instruments have multiple charges.  When a magical 
object has no more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be successful, see the help entries
on the skills instruments, scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.

NOTE: Only bard classes will get the perform skill.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
~

0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to your god for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Gaalstrom.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.
If you are a member of a clan that has it's own reincarnation room,
your god will transport you there, unless you have been labeled a thief
or killer.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs 1/4 of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.

You may also type RECALL CLAN to recall to your clan hall.
Or, you can recall to the temple altar by tying RECALL ALTAR.

You may also set your recall point using RECALL HERE.

~

-1 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold> <platinum>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), the second gold (optional), and the
third platinum (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
split  5  0  10 --> split 5 silver, 10 platinum

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con>
Syntax: train <hp mana move> <all or number>

Samples: train mana 25
         train hp all

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practicing or training anything else.


~

110 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

110 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

110 WEDPOST~
Syntax: wedpost <character>

WEDPOST sets or removes the wedpost flag on a mortal player.  This flag
allows a mortal to post to the wedding announcement message list.
~

109 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~


108 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROT. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 101), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

109 DENY WIPE~
Syntax: deny <name>
        wipe <name>

DENY and WIPE lock a character out of a game permanently, rendering their
character name unusable.  They may only be removed by editing the pfile, for
this reason freeze is usually preferred.

If a player is DENY'd, they will be sent a message telling them so, then
will be forced to quit.  They will then receive a message telling them
they are denied access any time they try to connect.

If a player is WIPE'd, they will receive no message, and will be immediately
disconnected.  They will immediately be disconnected any time they attempt
to connect, with no explanation.
~

107 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

106 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

109 DUPE~
Syntax: dupe <character> <name>

DUPE will add or remove a dupe account name to a list kept on the players
account.  Anytime this player connects, all characters on their dupe list
will be forced to quit (except immortals).  This should be used only on
those who flagrantly violate the rule against bringing in more than one
character at a time and using one character to build a second.  Entering
a dupe that is already on the list will cause it to be removed.

Using DUPE <character> without the second argument will list that
characters current dupes.
~

-1 QUEST~
Syntax: quest          Turns your quest flag on.
        quest <on|off> Imms only, turns global quest flag on/off.

The quest flag identifies players participating in a quest.  It also
protects the player during a quest, by making them non-pkill.

The quest flag can only be set when the global quest flag is on, and
can not be turned off until you either quit and relog, or the quest has
been completed.  Upon the completion of the quest, the flag will be
turned off automatically when the global quest flag is removed.

When the global quest flag is on, a message will be displayed at the
bottom of the 'who' list.
~

102 MQUEST MPOINT~
Syntax: mquest <object>
        mpoint <object>

MQUEST sets or removes the quest flag on any object.  A mortal character
may only carry ONE item with the quest flag set.

MPOINT sets or removes the questpoint flag on any object.  Any character
who then uses this object will receive a quest point.  The questpoint
flag is automatically removed from an object by the system once the
quest point has been given.
~

103 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 107 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

102 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

104 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

104 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

105 NOCHANNEL NOCLAN NOEMOTE NORESTORE NOSHOUT NOTELL NOTITLE~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noclan    <character>
	noemote   <character>
	norestore <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>
	notitle   <character>

NOEMOTE, NOSHOUT, and NOTELL are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The NOCHANNEL command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.

The NORESTORE command makes a player immune to the restore command.
This is used to punish players who constantly ask for restores from
immortals.

The NOCLAN command makes a player unable to join pkill-type clans.
This is used to punish players who are known to cause serious troubles
with pkilling.

The NOTITLE command makes a player unable to set their own title.
This is used to punish players who use the title for swearing,
threats, etc....
~

103 TWIT PARDON~
Syntax: twit   <character>
        pardon <character>

TWIT sets the Twit flag on a player.  When set, the twit flag causes
any mobiles in a LAW room (all of Gaalstrom) to attack the player,
and the shopkeepers will not sell to the player.  Also, any player may
attack and kill a player with the twit flag, whether they can normally
pkill or not.

PARDON will remove the Twit flag if set.
~

102 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~

106 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

107 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

104 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~

102 RECOVER~
Syntax: recover <character>

Recover transfers the target character to their default recall point.
You may only recover a character who is either cursed, or is stuck in
a no-recall area.
~

104 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

102 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~

102 GOTO~
Syntax: goto
        goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

Goto with no argument will take you to your default location if you
have one set. (see GSET)  If used in this manner, your pet will be
transfered with you.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~

102 GSET~
Syntax: gset <vnum>

Gset allows you to set the default location for the goto command to
take you to.
~

102 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will make you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 110 characters are totally 
invisible.
~

102 INCOGNITO GHOST~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.
Toggling your ghost status will do the exact opposite, making you invisible
to anyone in the same room as you, but visible to those outside the room.
While ghost is set, you will still appear visible to all characters in the
game through the 'who' command. (depending on your wizinv level)
Both take a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level
or higher can see you regarless of location.
These flags are mutually exclusive, turning on one will automatically turn
the other off.
~

102 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

102 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>
	vnum area

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name. Vnum area lists
all areas and their range of vnums.
(see also load)
~

102 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

102 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~

104 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

102 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

109 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~

105 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

103 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~

102 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message>
	immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.
Using this command with no argument turns off the immortal channel (or
turns it back on).
~

-1 WIZNET~
Syntax: wiznet 
	wiznet show
	wiznet status
	wiznet <field>

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immortal.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.
~

-1 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~

105 WIZSLAP~

them for a period of 5 game hours.

Syntax: pack <character>

Pack is used to equip a newbie with a survival pack.
~

0 'mana shield'~
Syntax: cast 'mana shield'

For a short time a mage can project a shield of mana around his or her body
which will deflect limited amounts of damage. The shield is rather unstable
and is prone to fading in and out of alignment with the mage, causing it to
be somewhat ineffective in combat. There are rumors of a similar spell that
is powerful enough to completely neutralize any attack. 
~

0 WARD~
Syntax: cast ward

is capable of absorbing even the most powerful of attacks. The cost is high

1.5x ( 25 needed ), 
2x   ( 50 needed ),
2.5x ( 75 needed ),

(I think the numbers are off.  I'll check them later.  ({*K(x))
~

0 'CURE LIGHT' 'CURE SERIOUS' 'CURE CRITICAL' HEAL~
Syntax: cast 'cure light'    <character>
Syntax: cast 'cure serious'  <character>
Syntax: cast 'cure critical' <character>

heal more damage.

(see 'help healer' for details on the heal command)
~

0 CURSE~
Syntax: cast 'curse' <character>

This spell reduces the character's to-hit roll and save versus spells.

opponents.

dangerous for casters who are not pure of heart.
~
0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~
Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <characte>
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.
~

0 EMPOWER~
Syntax: cast empower <spell>

This spell magically binds another spell to either a scroll, or a
potion, depending on the type of spell being bound.  This spell
can be quite costly in terms of mana, since not only does it use
mana for this spell, but also for the spell being bound.
~

0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the
weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon by one...and there is no turning back.
~

-1 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~
The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics. It is
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive
effects.  Each successful enchant increases the plus of the armor by 1 or 2
points, and raises its level by one.

This spell saps the experience points, mana, and movement points of its

Syntax: cast poison <object>

victim's regeneration rate. It may also be used to poison food, drink, or
a weapon in a fashion similar to envenom ('help envenom'), but with 
drastically reduced effectiveness.
~

0 ANIMATE~

mobiles.  These are not considered pets, so there is no limit to the

the effects of another use for 1 tick.

{RWARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING{x
Having a voodoo doll in your inventory makes you vulnerable to
{RPKILL{x by the victim of the curse, with {RNO{x restrictions
of level, tier, or clan affiliation.
Because of this, you cannot give a voodoo doll to another person,
or use the transport spell on a doll, they must pick it up of their

vanish.

0 eyerub~
A quick sweep of the palm across ones' eyes in combat can often mean the difference
between life and death. Whether it is through natural occurrence or the maneuver of
a stealthy foe, being blind and being in battle are never a good combination.

Currently, eyerub is only effective on dirt kick, not gouge.
~

0 powersurge~
A skill learned by only the most skilled of sorcerers, this is the dangerous art 
of releasing a torrent of unchanneled mana into ones' body. The result is an in-
crease in speed, both mentally and physically, and a finer attunement to streams
of magic. Because of its extreme influence on the mind and body of the caster, a
great number of sorcerers have developed a fierce addiction to this cantrip.
~

0 wspit~
Syntax: wspit <victim>
        wspit

Certain aquatic races and crude humanoids have picked up a technique of spitting
such a nasty stream of water, saliva, and phlegm that it not only insults their

able to recover more quickly from this disabling affect.

Syntax: cast 'summon songbird' <sparrow|mockingbird|dove|raven>
Syntax: cast 'resurrect' <zombie|skeleton|spectre|wraith>

Each of the spell-casting classes is able to summon a variety of powerful
familiars.  As the spellcaster's skill increases, he will be able to call
upon a broader variety of companions though he may keep only one at a time.
To summon one of these beings, the caster must lend his strength to bring
it to life and is therefore weakened after summoning.

Archons, summoned by priests, are divine beings of great strength.
Striders and the like may call animal companions to their side.
Druids can call upon powerful elementals to aid them.
Mephits, imp-like beings of the elemental planes, answer mages' calls.
Bards are able to summon songbirds of surprising merit to sing with them.
Necromancers can transform the corpses of their victims into various undead.

been blinded.

0 sharpen~
Syntax: sharpen <bladed weapon>

Familiar with weaponry, warriors often learn to sharpen their blades
to fine edges, inflicting greater damage. The process sometimes goes
awry, however, dulling the blade beyond repair. Such weapons are now
useless.

(This adds the "sharp" flag to weapons, but might consume it if failed.)
