    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are
        no longer required.

sits in the middle of the room, its wooden chair often filled by
a rather large guard with a very kind face. A window to the east
looks out on what might have once been the coach yard but is now
being used to house what look like small, malformed dragons.  To

The smells of baking bread and simmering stew lead you dancing through

walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood, rescued
from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards carved and
painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some musical or
other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the wonderful
smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window looks out over
the Gaalstrom River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock and the South
Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south returns you to
the Concourse.  On most days you will find Esme here, testing a batch of
stew or brewing a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for

A solid structure made entirely of thick heavy stones.  A large stone
wall seperates the bankers from the citizens.  Iron bars embedded in the
wall assure safe transactions.  Towards the back a large metal door can be
seen.  The bank vault was built by the dwarves and is the safest in the
world, the lock was created by the gnomes and promises anyone without the
key a very hard time indeed of getting it open.  Only the banker, and the
mayor have keys.  A tall, muscular guard stands watch for any signs of
trouble.  North leads back to the main street.

The Journeymen Guild has been a part of Gaalstrom since its conception. 
They are an organization dedicated to protecting the treasures found within
the great city.  Membership has dwindled in the past few years and the
Journeymen are hard up for people to do their services.  They hand out tasks
to any brave adventurer who wants one.  With such evil in the world tasks
such as these are never in short supply.

A caustic aroma bubbles up from the back of this dark shop.  At first,
it's difficult to guage just exactly what's sold here, but the huge variety
of shrunken heads which line the shelves of this small shop give it away.
Heads of nearly every species can be seen, many marked "Not For Sale!"  In
the back, a long table acts as the shop counter.  Behind it, an old trollish
woman is bent over a black cauldron, from which the nasty smell seems to
arise. Though she keeps her head down, her eye seems to follow all movement
within the shop.
